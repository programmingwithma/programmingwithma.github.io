# print("A smartphone is a mobile device that combines cellular and mobil\
# computing functions into one unit. They are distinguished from feature \
# phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile \
# operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including \
# web browsing[1] over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality\
# (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone\
# functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically \
# contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit \
# (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by their \
# software (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope,\
#  or accelerometer), and support wireless communications protocols \
#  (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).")
